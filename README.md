# AnimeDSProject

This was our final project for our Introductory to Data Science course.
Creators: Ahto TÃ¼rkson, Bogdan Mihhailjuk

We created an Anime recommender and Anime rating predictor algorithm.
Also we did some data analysing which results are on the poster file.

Data is downloadaed from here

You have to store it in a folder called data to use our programs without modifications.
